# README
The python scripts presented here produce the output seen in "A Robust Approach to Gaussian Process Implementation"
The python scripts are setup in 2 sub-folders:
-data
-py_functions

Folder Descriptions:

data: This folder contains two .ipynb files, one with simulated dataset and another one with real dataset. Both datasets are used as inputs for the py_functions folder.

py_functions: this folder contains 6 .py files described below:
      -test_lool.py runs the 'lool' loss function for the regular sampling method
      -test_looph.py runs the 'looph' loss function for the regular sampling method
      -lool_hybrid.py runs the 'lool' loss function for the hybrid method
      -looph_hybrid runs the 'looph' loss function for the hybrid method
      -DownS_lool runs the 'lool' loss function for the Down-Sampling approach
      -DownS_looph runs the 'looph' loss function for the Down-Sampling approach
